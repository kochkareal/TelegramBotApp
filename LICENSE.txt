Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

*Preamble*

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other
practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps:
(1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
nonfree. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
